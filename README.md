**Welcome to your project**

This is a React + Vite application originally generated by Base44. All
Base44-specific code has been stripped out; the application now runs locally
with stubbed services and can be adapted to use any backend or authentication
provider you choose (e.g. Clerk).

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** using your Git URL.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   `ash
   cd C:\Project
   npm install
   `
3. **Configure environment variables** by creating a file called
   `.env.local` in the project root. Below is an example using the Clerk and
   Supabase credentials you provided (replace with your own if they change):

   ```env
   # Clerk (frontend auth)
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_bW9yYWwtY3ViLTQyLmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
   VITE_CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_T1IdEQgDJhyesCHeT3Zi2Q9ies31bf4sUcpQYKQGHT

   # Supabase (data storage)
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://urqesijbanqdfsnxdkyr.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InVycWVzaWpiYW5xZGZzbnhka3lyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NzE4MzMxNzAsImV4cCI6MjA4NzQwOTE3MH0.a0TVwRzQWN6pxfv4tqcFtYxID243jymw3YxYfSz4gNY
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InVycWVzaWpiYW5xZGZzbnhka3lyIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTgzMzE3MCwiZXhwIjoyMDg3NDA5MTcwfQ.06tEmEmqM_TT6pXrNCfQdxwPEVAnX260suZkK93JlNI
   ```

   The old Base44 environment variables are no longer required.
4. **Run the development server**:
   `ash
   npm run dev
   `
   Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in your
   browser.

### Building for Production

`ash
npm run build
npm run preview   # serve the production build locally
`

### Customizing Authentication

Authentication is managed by src/lib/AuthContext.jsx. It currently
provides a basic stub that always considers the user authenticated. To
integrate Clerk (or another provider) replace the contents of that file with
calls to your chosen SDK. Your Clerk keys can be read from environment
variables as shown above.

### Cleaning Up

* All @base44/* packages have been removed from package.json.
* The Base44 Vite plugin is no longer used.
* `src/api/apiClient.js` now contains a generic stub that you can rename
  or repurpose for your own API client.

Feel free to rename files, add services, or restructure the code as needed �
this repo is now a normal React project with no external AI dependency.

### Support

There is no longer an external service powering this app. Use your own
internal documentation or the support channels for whatever authentication
or backend services you adopt.
